= Docker Alpine Base

Provides a base link:https://www.alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux] Docker image with a minimal set of
tooling. Great for being used as a foundational image for building on top of, for example, the
link:https://alchemists.io/projects/docker-alpine-ruby[Docker Alpine Ruby] image.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.docker.com[Docker].

== Setup

To set up the project, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/docker-alpine-base.git
cd docker-alpine-base
git checkout 3.1.0
----

== Usage

All versions of this image can be found on
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/bkuhlmann/alpine-base[Docker Hub]. The image can be pulled as follows:

[source,bash]
----
docker pull bkuhlmann/alpine-base:latest  # Pull latest version.
docker pull bkuhlmann/alpine-base:3.1.0   # Pull specific version.
----

You can also build on top of this image via your `Dockerfile`:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM bkuhlmann/alpine-base:latest  # Latest version.
FROM bkuhlmann/alpine-base:3.1.0   # Specific version.
----

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/docker-alpine-base.git
cd docker-alpine-base
----

To build, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/build
----

To use the console, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

To deploy a new version (i.e. `1.2.3`), run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/deploy 1.2.3
----

Deploying, without specifying a version, will default to tagging the image as `latest`. Best practice is to deploy both the latest version and specific tag. Example:

[source,bash]
----
bin/deploy
bin/deploy 1.2.3
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
bash --version
curl --version
git --version
gpg --version
openssl version
ssh -V
vim --version
----
